L11. Arrow Functions and the "this" Keyword
    Key diffrence betwen function and arrow function 
    function: changes this context
    arrow: does not change the context
    Example :
        https://jsbin.com/lubinasano/1/edit?js,console,output

L12. Functions and Default Parameters
    can set default peramiters by adding = and the value after the peramiter
        Example: 
            https://jsbin.com/nojocilequ/edit?js,console

    if I pass one argument to a function with 2 arguments only the first argument will get set
        Example :
            https://jsbin.com/xunamoquqa/edit?js,console 

    If we set the second one however we dont get undefined
        Example: 
            https://jsbin.com/xunamoquqa/edit?js,console

    we can also make calculations
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/xunamoquqa/edit?js,console

    intrestingly we can also use other arguments as well like so.
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/xunamoquqa/1/edit?js,console
    this is only when no other value is provided

    If I provide the value that one is used instead of the default value
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/xunamoquqa/1/edit?js,console

    we can also set a variable from the outside as a default variable
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/xunamoquqa/1/edit?js,console

    I can not set a default peramiter to a value that has not been set yet
        Example:
            <a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/xunamoquq

    if we switch it around number has been defined so it works
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/magovufilo/1/edit?js,console

    the benifits of default functions is that I can write more dynamic functions which might have 3 peramiters but u only need to pass one
        
L.13 Object Literal Extensions

    regular Object
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/kocugev/edit?js,console

    If the name and age arent in the object they will be taken from variables around them
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/kocugev/edit?js,console
    name and age arent defined so they are pulled from the name and age variables outside of the object

    Define Method
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/kocugev/edit?js,consolehttps://jsbin.com/kocugev/edit?js,console
    
    I can define the same method with greet as a string resulting in the same thing
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/kocugev/edit?js,console

    This allows me to do things that I otherwise wouldnt be able to do like Include white-space in the method name
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/kocugev/edit?js,console

    create properties dynamically with the name stored in variables
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/kocugev/edit?js,console

L.14 The Rest Operator
        Example:
            https://jsbin.com/kocugev/edit?js,console

        with a string
            Example: https://jsbin.com/kocugev/edit?js,console
